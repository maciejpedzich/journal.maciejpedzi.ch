    <h2>about</h2>
    <p>Hi, welcome to my journal! I started it in June 2022, because prior to that point, I would often find myself struggling with consistently publishing comprehensive tutorial articles due to various time constraints outside of my control (pronounced: <em>skuːl laɪf</em>). This usually resulted in me scrapping a post entirely, leaving me frustrated and less eager to try writing a different guide.</p>
    <p>For this blog, I've decided to employ a revised content creation strategy, where each article outlines a certain programming problem or some kind of design limitation I've faced, followed by a thorough description of the solution I've ended up implementing (code snippets and live demos included). So go ahead and check out my latest posts in the <em>home</em> section!</p>

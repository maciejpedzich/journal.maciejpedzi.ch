      Hi, welcome to my journal! I started it in June 2022, because prior to
      that point, I would often find myself struggling with consistently
      publishing comprehensive tutorial articles due to various time constraints
      outside of my control (pronounced: <em>sku&#720; la&#618;f</em>). This
      usually resulted in me scrapping a post entirely, leaving me frustrated
      and less eager to try writing a different guide.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this blog, I've decided to employ a revised content creation strategy
      for my main line of articles, where each post outlines a certain
      programming problem or some kind of design limitation I've faced, followed
      by a thorough description of the solution I've ended up implementing (code
      snippets and live demos included).
    </p>
    <p>
      Because
      <em>man does not live by tutorial articles alone</em>, you'll also get to
      read about some of my other projects, which don't revolve solely around
      writing a web application. In these types of article series I'll mostly
      write about setting up certain hardware to run some piece of software
      (with its configuration getting a write-up it deserves too). There's place
      for some off-topic talk as well!
    </p>

      So go ahead and check out my latest posts in the <em>home</em> section!
